# WallpaperDownloader-linux
This script uses the reddit API to download the most downloaded wallpaper in r/wallpapers in the last day. And if specified, it sets it on your machine with feh.

I suggest running it on the machine's startup at least for only downloading the wallpapers, that way you'll have a collection of wallpapers without moving a finger.

## Options
Currently it only supports two options:
```
d: Downloads the wallpaper to the directory specified.
dw: Downloads the wallpaper and sets it with feh.
```

*Reminder:* Dont use dashes or double-dashes for using the options, it won't work.
